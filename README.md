<h1>WorkVent</h1>
Workvent is a campus placement portal designed using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack, which allows students to create and modify their profiles, and showcase all the information that is typically included in a resume. Companies can post job listings, modify them, and review the list of candidates who have applied.<br />
The portal also includes an interview feature where students can participate in final or mock interviews from the platform itself.
